Project Name: ANCIENT LIES

This is my first attempt to make a whole animation movie in Blender.
Ancient Lies is about how an airplane pilot accidentally discovers the 
truth about a global conspiracy, involving many governments around the 
world, regarding the cover up of aliens and development of Mankind 
History.

What you consider "common sense" regarding politicians, corruption 
scandals, power, wars, religion, ethnicity and so on, might not be as 
simple and straighforward as you think ...
